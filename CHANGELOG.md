## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project scaffolding: Cargo project, CI workflow, development docs (project brief, development plan, Rust guidelines), agent conventions (`AGENTS.md`).
- Core logic (M1): key notation parser (`C-h`, `Back`, ...), per-application keymap resolution with app-over-global priority, and TOML config loading with line-numbered validation errors. Config file format spec (`docs/04_config-spec.md`) and `examples/minimal.toml`.
- Win32 layer (M2): `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook with injected-event passthrough, `SendInput` sender with modifier lift/restore for exact-rule targets, foreground process name caching via `SetWinEventHook`, and a CLI entry point (`--config`, default `%APPDATA%\winremap\config.toml`).
- Resident features (M3): task tray icon (enable/disable toggle, config reload, open config, quit) via the `tray-icon` crate, hot reload with atomic table swap that keeps the previous config on errors, and single-instance guard via a named mutex.
- Release readiness (M4): `examples/emacs.toml` (fakeymacs-style bindings), README (en/ja), `SECURITY.md` with release verification steps, release workflow (exe + SHA256SUMS + build provenance attestation, draft release), CODEOWNERS, and owner runbook (`docs/06_release-operations.md`).
